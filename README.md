# optimal_graduate_schools
 
Back in 2021-11-03, I was a senior in my fall semester of college. I was reading about stock market stuff, learning R, and applying to graduate schools. I decided to try and combine them all as a learning experience by creating Markowitz’s Efficient Frontier of Optimal ~~Portfolios and Allocation~~ **Graduate Schools**

My loose goal was to find the optimal graduate school using R. At the time, I thought that this would be good practice for an R beginner like me.

## Loose Goals:
1. I didn’t want a school that is a research mill.
2. Yet, I still wanted a school that has an impact on research.
