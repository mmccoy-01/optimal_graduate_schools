# optimal_graduate_schools
 
Back in 2021-11-03, I was a senior in my fall semester of college. I was reading about stock market stuff, learning R, and applying to graduate schools. I decided to try and combine them all as a learning experience by creating Markowitz’s Efficient Frontier of Optimal ~~Portfolios and Allocation~~ **Graduate Schools**

My loose goal was to find the optimal graduate school using R. I wanted a school that had an impact on research yet wasn't a research mill. At the time, I thought that this would be good practice for an R beginner like me.

I first filtered by ‘Bolder’ Boulder Model programs which basically are schools that have high research-related accreditation and membership standards. Then, I printed a scatterplot of the ‘Bolder’ Boulder institutions: X-axis = Impact, Y-axis = Citations. Impact was defined as Citations/Web of Science Documents). All citations and web of science documents were across a 5 year period from 2012 to the end of 2016.
